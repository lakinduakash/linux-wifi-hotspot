* Compatible with iw 6.7

#### Project Update

Hi everyone — I've been inactive on this project for a while due to other commitments. I'm now actively looking for contributors and maintainers to help keep the project alive and growing.

If you're interested in contributing — whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or developing new features — please open an issue to introduce yourself.

I'm also open to adding trusted collaborators with commit access who demonstrate consistent contributions and interest.

Thanks for being part of the community and keeping Linux-WiFi-Hotspot going!

### Features

* Share your wifi like in Windows - Use wifi and enable hotspot at the same time.
* Share a wifi access point from any network interface
* [Create a hotspot with VPN](#vpn-hotspot) - The hotspot has the traffic tunnelled through VPN. Useful for devices with no VPN app support like TV or gaming consoles.
* Share wifi via QR code
* MAC filter
* View connected devices
* Includes Both command line and GUI.
* Support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz (Need to be compatible with your wifi adapter). Ex: You have connected to the 5GHz network and share a connection with 2.4GHz.
* Customise wifi Channel, Change MAC address, etc.
* Hide SSID
* customize gateway IP address
* Enable IEEE 80211n, IEEE 80211ac and IEEE 80211ax modes

### Command line help and documentation

Read [Command line help and documentation here](src/scripts/README.md).

If you only need the command line without GUI run `make install-cli-only` as the root user.

### Notes

- Sometimes there are troubles with **5Ghz bands** due to some vendor restrictions. If you cannot start the hotspot while you are connected to the 5Ghz band, Unselect **Auto** and select **2.4Ghz** in frequency selection.

- If any problems with **RealTeK Wifi Adapters** see [this](docs/howto/realtek.md)

- **Unable to allocate IP: firewalld issue:** Please check for potential fixes: [#209](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/issues/209) [#166](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/issues/166)

sudo dnf install -y gtk3-devel gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel pkg-config make hostapd qrencode-devel libpng-devel
```

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot
    cd linux-wifi-hotspot

    #build binaries
    make

    #install
    sudo make install

## Uninstallation
    sudo make uninstall

## Running
You can launch the GUI by searching for "Wifi Hotspot" in the Application Menu
or using the terminal with:

    wihotspot

<h2 id="vpn-hotspot">Create VPN Hotspot</h2>

After connecting to VPN, Open `wihotspot` GUI. Select the virtual interface created by the VPN. In this case it is `tun0`

## Run on Startup
The `wihotspot` GUI uses `create_ap` to create and manage access points. This service and core logic were originally created by
[@oblique](http://github.com/oblique), and are now maintained in this
repository.

Start the hotspot service on startup (using your saved configuration) with:

    systemctl enable create_ap
